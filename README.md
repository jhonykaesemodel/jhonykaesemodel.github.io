# My minimal site

Edit `index.html` directly. To add a paper, add a new `<li>` under the Publications list.

Links can point to arXiv, DOI, or local files placed in the root directory.

## Deploy

Simply commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update site"
git push
```

Your site will be served directly from the root files.
